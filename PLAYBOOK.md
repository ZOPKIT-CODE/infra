# Suite Deployment & Onboarding Playbook

The one doc a new dev reads before touching deploys. Covers how the suite is
wired, how to ship one app at a time to ECS Fargate, how migrations and
observability work, and the hard-won rules that prevent self-inflicted outages.

---

## 1. What you're deploying

Three apps, each a backend + an SPA frontend, plus one worker:

| App | Backend (Fargate) | Port | Frontend (S3+CloudFront SPA) | Role |
|-----|-------------------|------|------------------------------|------|
| **wrapper** | `wrapper-web` | 3000 | `app.<domain>` | **Source of truth** — tenants, onboarding, identity (Cognito), credits |
| **crm** (b2b-crm) | `crm-web` | 4000 | `crm.<domain>` | CRM; consumes wrapper events |
| **fa** (finance-accounting) | `fa-web` + `fa-consumer` | 3002 | `accounting.<domain>` | Accounting; consumes wrapper + business events |

**Two message buses (SNS → SQS, with DLQs):**
- **Platform bus** — wrapper publishes `tenant.onboarded`, `role.*`, `user.*`,
  `credit.*`, `configuration.updated` to CRM/FA.
- **Business bus** — CRM/FA publish domain events (`entity.created`, …) via the
  shared `@zopkit/platform-sdk` `SnsPublisher`.

**Why you can deploy one app at a time:** every publish is **outbox-first** and
delivered through SQS. Wrapper can emit `tenant.onboarded` before CRM/FA even
exist — the queue buffers it (DLQ backs it up) and the consumer drains it when it
comes up. Deploy in dependency order: **wrapper → crm → fa**.

Backends run their **SQS consumers + outbox poller in-process** (only FA split out
`fa-consumer`). Postgres is **Supabase** (external). Permission caches are Valkey
(optional; fall back to an in-process Map when `REDIS_ENABLED` is off).

---

## 2. Prerequisites

- **Tools:** Docker, AWS CLI v2 (logged in / SSO), Terraform ≥ 1.5, Node 20, `pnpm`, `git`, `jq`.
- **AWS access** to the target account with ECR push, ECS, and Terraform-state permissions.
- **The three repos** cloned as siblings: `wrapper/`, `b2b-crm/`, `finance-accounting/`.
- **`@aws` note:** Fargate runs **x86**. If you're on Apple Silicon you MUST build
  with `--platform linux/amd64` (the deploy script does this for you).

---

## 3. Infrastructure (Terraform) — `deploy/ecs/terraform`

All infra is defined here: VPC, ECS Fargate cluster (Container Insights on), ECR,
ALB + ACM/Route53, SNS/SQS + DLQs, Secrets Manager, Cognito, S3 + CloudFront
(frontends), ElastiCache Valkey. Naming is `${project}-${environment}` →
`local.name_prefix` (e.g. `zopkit-prod`).

### One-time foundation provisioning
```bash
cd deploy/ecs/terraform
terraform init
cp terraform.tfvars.example terraform.tfvars   # fill in: region, domain, project, environment
terraform plan -out tf.plan
terraform apply tf.plan
```
**Startup cost levers (set in `terraform.tfvars`):**
- `single_nat_gateway = true` — one NAT, not per-AZ.
- Keep `desired_count = 1`; leave Valkey unused for v1 (in-process cache is correct at 1 task).
- `crm-web` / `fa-web` / `fa-consumer` stay **pinned to 1** (autoscaling off) — see §7.

Then populate **Secrets Manager** per app: `DATABASE_URL`, Cognito vars,
`SENTRY_DSN`, SNS topic ARNs, AWS messaging creds, `REDIS_ENABLED=false`.

### Per-service image tags
`services.tf` resolves each service's image as
`…:${try(var.service_image_tags[<service>], data.aws_ssm_parameter.deployed_tag[<service>].value)}`.
The record of what's live is **SSM Parameter Store**
(`/<project>/<env>/deployed-tag/<service>`), written by every release path
*before* its apply — so a secrets roll or full apply from any checkout
preserves what is actually running. Git holds no tag record (a committed one
went stale and rolled staging CRM back four commits, 2026-06-12). Emergency
pin / bootstrap: pass `-var='service_image_tags={"crm-web"="<sha>"}'`.

---

## 4. Deploying an app — the 6-step unit

Use the script (one command per app). First time only:
```bash
cd deploy/ecs
cp deploy.env.example deploy.env      # fill in (gitignored): account, region, name_prefix, repo paths, subnets, SG, health URLs
```

Then:
```bash
./deploy-service.sh wrapper-web            # tag defaults to the repo's git short SHA
# ./deploy-service.sh wrapper-web 1a2b3c4  # or pin an explicit SHA
```

The script does, for that one service:
1. **build** — `docker build --platform linux/amd64 --target production`
2. **push** — to ECR with an **immutable git-SHA tag** (never `:latest`)
3. **migrate** — DB migrations as a one-off Fargate task (web services only; see §5)
4. **release** — record the tag + `terraform apply -target` just this service
5. **wait** — block on `ecs wait services-stable`
6. **smoke** — `GET /health` until 200

**Rollout order (first deploy):** `wrapper-web` → wrapper frontend → `crm-web` →
crm frontend → `fa-web` + `fa-consumer` → fa frontend.

### Frontends (SPA → S3 + CloudFront)
Built **with prod envs baked in** (Vite inlines them at build time):
```bash
VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://api.<domain> VITE_SENTRY_DSN=<fe-dsn> pnpm --filter wrapper-frontend build
aws s3 sync frontend/dist s3://<name_prefix>-wrapper-fe --delete
aws cloudfront create-invalidation --distribution-id <id> --paths "/*"
```

---

## 5. Migrations

- **Baseline model:** migrations are squashed to a prod-faithful `0000_baseline.sql`
  (a `pg_dump` of production) + incremental files, guarded by a **CI schema-drift
  gate**. A fresh DB applies the baseline then the increments cleanly.
- **In the container, run the COMPILED runner:**
  `node dist/db/run-migrations.js` — **not** `pnpm db:migrate` (which needs `tsx`,
  a devDependency absent from the prod image). The deploy script already uses the
  compiled command for `wrapper-web`.
- **Run as a one-off task BEFORE the new code serves** (the script does this), so a
  bad migration can't crashloop the service. Use **expand/contract** for schema
  changes (add column in release N, drop in N+1 — never drop in the same release
  as the code that stops using it).
- **Pre-deploy check (run locally):**
  ```bash
  cd backend
  node scripts/db/check-journal.mjs    # journal consistency
  npx vitest run                       # unit  (236 tests)
  npx vitest run --config vitest.integration.config.ts   # spins fresh PG, APPLIES ALL MIGRATIONS, runs integration (≈249)
  ```
  The integration suite proves the baseline applies on an empty DB — green here = safe to deploy.

---

## 6. Observability & verification

Stack: **Sentry (Mode A: `@sentry/node` owns the OTel provider) + OpenTelemetry**,
across all 6 services. After a deploy, verify:
- **Sentry** (org `zopkit-cg`): the service shows the request trace and **no startup errors**.
- **Health:** `GET https://api.<domain>/health` → 200; ALB target group healthy.
- **An event flows:** onboard a test tenant → confirm `tenant.onboarded` lands in SNS→SQS.

**What's instrumented (and was hardened):**
- **Distributed tracing end to end:** sync FE→BE *and* async **SNS→SQS** (publisher
  injects `sentry-trace`/`baggage`/`traceparent` into message attributes; consumers
  extract → continue the trace). Proven live: a `credit.allocated` trace spanning
  wrapper-frontend → wrapper-backend (`publish`) → crm-backend (`consume`).
- **Producer spans** (`op: queue.publish`) wrap every publish so background/cron
  publishes always have a valid trace to inject. Fan-out (`*ToSuite`) wrapped in a
  parent span so background fan-outs stay on one trace.
- **Job spans:** `credit-expiry.tick`, `outbox-replay.tick`, `outbox-poller.tick`.
- **AWS SDK semantic spans** (`@opentelemetry/instrumentation-aws-sdk`): `SNS Publish`,
  `SQS ReceiveMessage/DeleteMessage`, `S3`. Idle empty-poll receive transactions are
  dropped via `beforeSendTransaction` (message_count 0).
- **DSNs** live in Secrets Manager per service; frontends bake `VITE_SENTRY_DSN` at build.

> Telemetry is a **no-op** until `SENTRY_DSN` (backend) / `VITE_SENTRY_DSN` (frontend)
> is set, and a service only emits once it's actually running.

## 7. The rules that prevent outages (read this twice)

1. **Immutable tags only.** Deploy git-SHA tags, never `:latest`. Rollback =
   `./deploy-service.sh <service> <previous-sha>`.
2. **`crm-web`, `fa-web`, `fa-consumer` stay at 1 task (autoscaling OFF).** Their
   outbox pollers/crons are **not leader-gated**; a 2nd task = duplicate event
   processing. `wrapper-web` MAY autoscale — its pollers use `pg_try_advisory_lock`
   (leader-safe). Don't flip this without gating the others.
3. **Migrate with `node dist/db/run-migrations.js`**, not `pnpm db:migrate`, in-container.
4. **Build for `linux/amd64`** (Fargate is x86; matters on Apple Silicon).
5. **Don't upgrade deps/runtime right before a deploy.** Ship tested code; the stack
   intentionally diverges (Fastify 4/4/5, drizzle versions) — converge later, not at launch.
6. **Tenant isolation is sacred.** This is a financial multi-tenant system; a
   cross-tenant leak can end the company. A known escalation was fixed — keep the
   guard and add tests when you touch authz.
7. **`stopTimeout` + graceful drain:** ensure tasks get time on SIGTERM to
   `Sentry.flush()`, stop the poller, and finish in-flight SQS handlers — else you
   drop messages/telemetry on every deploy. *(Set this in the task def if not already.)*
8. **Secrets in Secrets Manager only** — never in env files or images.

---

## 8. Cost right-sizing (startup defaults)

`single_nat_gateway=true`; Fargate 0.25–0.5 vCPU; `desired_count=1`; Valkey
deferred (in-process cache); frontends on S3+CloudFront (not Fargate); Container
Insights on (small cost, keep it).

---

## 9. Minimum "launch-safe" checklist (before real/paying traffic)

Not enterprise SRE — the few cheap things that prevent silent data/money loss:
- [ ] `stopTimeout` + graceful drain set
- [ ] DB connection-pool sizes pinned per task (Supabase has hit "Max client connections")
- [ ] Supabase backups/PITR on + you've clicked restore once
- [ ] ~5 alarms → Slack: service has 0 running tasks, 5xx spike, **DLQ not-empty**
      (exists), SQS age-of-oldest-message, DB connections high
- [ ] Sentry alerts email a real person
- [ ] You know the rollback command
- [ ] `check-journal` + unit + integration suites green (§5)

Defer until growth/real incidents: SLOs, dashboards, tail-sampling collector,
synthetic/uptime, PagerDuty on-call, load testing, WAF, exhaustive isolation suite.
